#+TITLE: Integrating Buzz with C and C++

* Basics: The BuzzVM is Stack-Based
The Buzz VM is stack-based. This means that every operation the VM can
perform uses elements on a stack as operands. For instance, to perform
a sum, the Buzz VM takes the two top elements in the stack, sums them
together, pops them from the stack, and then pushes the result on the
stack.

For this reason, when you want to integrate Buzz with existing C or
C++ code, the interaction between the BuzzVM and external code must
occur through the stack.
